# HST -- Heterogeneous Scheduling Task
A User Mode Scheduler for FreeRTOS.

## Overview
This project implements a user-level scheduler through a user-level task, called Heterogeneous Scheduling Task (HST), in order to support Mixed Critical Systems in a very flexible way, on FreeRTOS v8.1.2.

The HST design is documented with detail in: *FreeRTOS User Mode Scheduler for Mixed Critical Systems*, Francisco E. Páez, José M. Urriza, Ricardo Cayssials, Javier D. Orozco. 2015 Sixth Argentine Conference on Embedded Systems (CASE). ISBN 978-987-45523-4-1, pp. 37-42, 2015.
