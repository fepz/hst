# Example Programs
Example projects that implements multiple scheduling policies using the User Mode Scheduler. These examples runs on the mbed LPC 1768 microcontroller.

## Examples
Current examples programs:
* `dp`: Dual Priority scheduling.
* `edf`: Earliest Deadline First scheduling.
* `rm`: Rate Monotonic scheduling.
* `ss`: Rate Monotonic scheduling with Slack Stealing method.
